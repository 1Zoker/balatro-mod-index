# Colorblind Seals
This is a texture replacement mod for the seals in Balatro. Because I am colorblind, I had a hard time differentiating between the blue and purple seals on the cards in hand, which led to discarding cards I should have kept and vice versa.

The textures for the seals are altered by this mod to all have unique shape for easier differentiation.

Requires **Malverk**

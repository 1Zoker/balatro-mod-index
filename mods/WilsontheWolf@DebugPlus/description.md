# DebugPlus
DebugPlus is a Balatro mod that adds a bunch of additional debug tools on top of Balatro's built in ones. Below are some of the highlights:

- Console for logging and commands
- Win blind button
- Support for spawning vouchers, boosters, tags and blinds
- Save states
- A comically oversized spoonful of [new keybinds](https://github.com/WilsontheWolf/DebugPlus/blob/master/keys.txt)

DebugPlus has a configuration UI which you can access from Mods > DebugPlus if Steamodded is installed, or Options > Settings > DebugPlus otherwise.

## Development
For more information on the DebugPlus features and apis for mod developers see the [dev docs](https://github.com/WilsontheWolf/DebugPlus/blob/master/docs/dev.md).

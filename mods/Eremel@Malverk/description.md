# Malverk - Manage Your Texture Packs
Malverk is a mod designed to make managing your texture packs quick and easy. Using our intuitive texture selector page, you can select which of your texture packs to apply in an instant, and reorganise their priority by dragging the cards left and right. This makes it easy to combine partial texture packs to your preference.
Malverk supports full and partial retextures to each object type in the game. Malverk supports the following objects: Joker, Tarot, Spectral, Planet, Voucher, Booster, Enhanced, Seal, Tag, Stake, Blind, Sticker, plus modded ConsumableTypes.

You can access Malverk through the in game option menu. Press the Textures button and you will be greeted with the Malverk UI.

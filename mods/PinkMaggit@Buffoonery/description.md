# Buffoonery
A Vanilla-adjacent content mod for the hit roguelike deckbuilder, Balatro.

**Requires Steamodded ALPHA 1.0.0-1315b or newer and Talisman**

## Content
Currently, 24 Jokers, 2 Enhancements, 3 Decks, 3 Sleeves (requiring Larswijn's CardSleeves), 1 Tarot and a new rarity.
### Mechanics
Special rarity: 3 jokers from this mod are Special. They don't show up in the collection (configurable) and are unobtainable, unless you meet specific criteria. For now, that means using a deck/sleeve combo related to them.

## Shoutout
Big thanks to the Balatro modding community for helping me on innumerous occasions with .lua code, artwork feddback and whatever elsa was hindering my progress with the mod.

# Deck Creator

Deck Creator is a tool for Balatro that allows users to create, save, load, and even share custom decks.

## Requirements

- Balatro 1.0.1o
- Steamodded v1.0.0

## How to Use

- Click on the "Mods" button on the main menu
- Click on "Deck Creator"
- Click on "Config"
- Click on "Create Deck"
- Choose all the options you would like. Options that are not changed will be defaulted to the normal default game options.
- Head back to the "General" tab when you're done, and click "Save Deck"
- The deck will be saved to a file called "CustomDecks.txt" under this mod's folder in another subdirectory.
- If you would like to share your deck list with anyone, all they need to do is copy and paste your CustomDecks.txt file and place it into the folder in their Mods directory. This mod will detect all .txt files in there and merge all the deck lists together and load all decks into the game.

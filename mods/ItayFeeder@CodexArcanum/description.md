This is a successor project to itayfeeder's Codex Arcanum

Codex Arcanum is a mod that aims to expand Balatro by adding a new type of consumable card: Alchemical Cards!

Alchemical cards possess powerful, but temporary abilities that you can use in a blind. Gain hands and discards mid-blind, duplicate cards, remove debuffs, and much more!

The are a total of 24 alchemical cards!

The mod also adds 8 new jokers, 4 new vouchers, 7 new booster packs, a Tarot card, a new Boss Blind, and a Spectral card, to expand the game and allow a smoother experience with alchemical cards.

As well as providing necessary bug fixes, the Redux Arcanum fork also implements a suite of balance changes and a few new features.

If you wish to play with the mechanics more faithful to the original mod, you can disable the new content by clicking the Redux Arcanum mod in the mod list and unchecking "new content".

# What is Pokermon?
Pokermon is a full content mod for Balatro, adding content based on Pokemon. There are over 250(!!) Pokemon Jokers that have been added alongside many other custom additions. 
There is also an option to only play with Pokemon Jokers if you want to focus on the new content.

Do you like Pokemon? Do you like Balatro? If you answered yes to either than this mod is for you! Either alongside the classic Balatro Jokers, or by themselves as a completely new way to play! 
You can't go wrong! This mod has a lot of effort and hard work put behind it, so I hope you'll enjoy!

# A Balatro Multiplayer Mod

This is a Balatro multiplayer mod developed by virtualized that allows you to compete with your friends in Balatro!

## DISCLAIMER

This version of the Multiplayer mod that is available on the Balatro Mod Manager is an **UNSTABLE** and **EXPERIMENTAL** release of our 1.0 version, if you would like to play the stable version of the mod then go to [our github page](https://github.com/V-rtualized/BalatroMultiplayer) or join the discord at https://discord.gg/W22FEqVWsq

## Dependancies

This mod requires [Galdur](https://github.com/Eremel/Galdur) and [MultiplayerAPI](https://github.com/V-rtualized/BalatroMultiplayerAPI) to work

## How it works

For this experimental version the main gamemode is Battle Royale, where up to 8 players join a lobby and then each boss blind is replaced by a PvP blind where players have to beat each other's scores or risk losing a life.

## Do I need to start a server to play with my friends?

No, there is an official server that you will automatically connect to when you start the game with the mod installed, although if you can host one yourself if you want to ([download the server files here](https://github.com/V-rtualized/BalatroMultiplayerAPI-Server)). You can also find random people to play with by joining the Balatro Multiplayer discord: https://discord.gg/W22FEqVWsq

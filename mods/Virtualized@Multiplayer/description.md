# A Balatro Multiplayer Mod

This is an **WIP** Balatro multiplayer mod developed by virtualized.

## How it works

For the most popular gamemode, each player will play the small and big blinds normally, and each boss blind will be a PvP blind where you are trying to beat the other player's score. You won't lose when you fail a blind but you will lose a life every time you lose to the other person, and there are lobby options set by the lobby host to modify how the gamemodes work or change the amount of lives each player has.

## Do I need to start a server to play with my friends?

No, there is an official server that you will automatically connect to when you start the game with the mod installed, although if you can host one yourself if you want to

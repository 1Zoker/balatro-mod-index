# A Balatro Multiplayer Mod

Compete with your friends in Balatro! Developed by Virtualized.

## How it works

Join a lobby with a friend, some blinds will be replaced with PvP Blinds where you must score higher than your opponent or lose a life!

## Do I need to start a server to play with my friends?

No, there is an official server that you will automatically connect to when you start the game with the mod installed, although you can host one yourself if you want to ([download the server files here](https://github.com/V-rtualized/BalatroMultiplayerAPI-Server)). You can also find random people to play with by joining the Balatro Multiplayer discord: https://discord.gg/W22FEqVWsq

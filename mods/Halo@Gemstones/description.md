# Gemstones
Gemstones is a Balatro mod that adds a new unique card modifier: **Gem Slots**! Gem Slots can be obtained in multiple ways, and can hold Gemstones.

## How do I get Gemstones?
Gemstones can be found from either the shop or a Gemstone Booster Pack, which contains 3 Gemstone cards and a copy of The Infusion tarot. There are other ways as well, such as from a The Excavator tarot or from a tag.

## How do I apply a Gemstone?
You can apply a Gemstone to a card or Joker (depending on what the description says) if it has a Gem Slot applied. If there is no Gem Slot, you can apply one by using a new tarot called The Infusion, which applies an Empty Gem Slot to 2 highlighted cards or Jokers.

## Extra Content
There is extra content built around the mod that can be enabled/disabled from the Conifg. The extra content are Jokers, Tags, Challenges, Vouchers, Blinds, and Decks.

# Betmma Vouchers: Adds 58 Vouchers and 24 fusion Vouchers.
Vouchers have rarities. Rarity affects the chance a voucher is added into the random pool. Only vouchers added into the pool can be chosen and appear. For example, if you have redeemed all vouchers but one uncommon, rare or legendary voucher, it still can not appear. Specifically, the chances for uncommon, rare and legendary vouchers to be in the pool are 1/2, 1/4 and 1/20. Vanilla vouchers and vouchers from other mods are considered common.
## Fusion Vouchers
Fusion Vouchers aren't fused by clicking a fusion button. Instead they appear randomly and can be bought regularly only after you have redeemed the required 2 vouchers. (May change in the future)

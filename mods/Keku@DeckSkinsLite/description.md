> [!CAUTION]
> DEPRECATED. This mod is made for compatibility with an old format for DeckSkins that is no longer used. As such, it is no longer being updated and I will not be giving any more support for it in the Balatro discord. **It will still work**, but I do not reccomend using it. If you can, PLEASE avoid using this, and use the DeckSkin API built into SMODS instead. It may be a bit more complicated, but it provides a much better system with many new features and optimizations. [Check out the SMODS Wiki Page for it here](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki/SMODS.DeckSkin).

# DeckSkinsLite

A mod for Balatro that simplifies the creation of custom skins for your deck. Custom Deck skins are automatically loaded from the mod's skins folder into the game.

## Creating New Deck Skins

All you need is a small .lua file that contains a table of variables in the /skins/ folder, and a 2 textures in the /assets/ folder (a 1x and 2x version).
Check the /.example/ folder for more details on how DeckSkinsLite add-ons are formatted, [or check the Documentation for more details!](https://github.com/Kekulism/DeckSkinsPlus/wiki/Skin-Documentation)

## Credits

Huge thanks to [OneSuchKeeper]([https://github.com/onesuchkeeper]) for converting the previous version of this mod, DeckSkins+, into an API inside Steammodded! Now DeckSkins can be added by anyone even if they don't use this mod :)

Adds a bunch of new vanilla-esc jokers that expand your choices in how you play and craft strong builds! All jokers and their art were personally developed by me, with a great amount of dev help from the Balatro Discord #modding-dev channel.

Most art currently is developer art, and many more jokers (at least 30!) and a few extras are planned to be added too (see the sheet).

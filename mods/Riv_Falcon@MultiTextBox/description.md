# MultiTextBox
### A Balatro UI mod where you can separate massive description texts into multiple boxes.
* Notice: This mod is passively supportive, which means:  
 unless authors of the mods purposely made their mods compatible with this mod,  
 this mod will _not_ be able to do anything if no compatible mod is around.  
 (But it won't crash your game if said situation happens.)
